    body: 'Right now all of our Angular templates are inlined in our applications layout. This is fine for now, but can become hard to organize as we add more views to our app. Luckily, there is a gem called angular-rails-templates that takes html templates and compiles them into javascript files that insert our templates into Angulars $templateCache. This allows us to move our templates into the app/assets/javascripts folder while referencing them in our app using the same syntax. Well be grouping our files in the javascripts folder by feature. Having templates and javascript in the same folder may seem weird if youre used to Rails directory structure, but it will make our project easier to navigate. See 1 in this list of top AngularJS mistakes.'
